# Real-Time Collaborative Notes App

#### Live link - https://my-notes-io.vercel.app/
### Objective

Build a real-time collaborative notes app where multiple users can create, edit, and view notes in real-time. Implement JWT-based authentication with access & refresh tokens for secure access and session management. The project utilizes React, WebSocket (Socket.io), Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.

## Frontend (React, Tailwind CSS, WebSocket) 

- Build authentication screens (Signup, Login, Logout). 
- Implement access token storage in memory (not local storage for security). 
- Automatically refresh access tokens when they expire using the refresh token. 
- Display a list of notes and enable real-time collaborative editing. 
- Show live updates when multiple users edit the same note.
